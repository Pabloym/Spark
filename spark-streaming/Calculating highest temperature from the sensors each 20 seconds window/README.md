# Brief explanation of the application.

Using the data produced by the file "Generate files with the temperature of each sensor.py", I have done a PySpark application that finds the highest temperature each 20 seconds, grouping by sensor.

Both scripts must be run simultaneously, and it is also necessary to update the paths where the sensor temperature files will be created and read.
