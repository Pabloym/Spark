# Brief explanation of the application.

Using the data produced by the file "Downloading data of Malaga Parking.py", I have done a PySpark application that compute the average of number of occupied slots for every parking each 5 minutes.

Both scripts must be run simultaneously, and it is also necessary to update the paths where the sensor temperature files will be created and read.
